Hi, My name is Gagandeep and I am from India. I have an experience of around 13 years in IT industry working on multiple data warehousing projects.
I have hands on expereince with designing data models and building reusable frameworks for error handling and data quality improvement.
Technologies I have worked on would include SQL, Python, Unix/Shell scripting, ETL(Extract Transform Load) and Redshift.
So far, I haven't got a chance to wok on front technologies in my career so far, therefore, I would like to get ramped up on front development in order to expand my horizon.
